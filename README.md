## Business Context
The company operates a **Global E-Commerce Business** serving customers across multiple regions. While overall revenue performance appears stable, **Business Management** has raised concerns about uneven profitability across regions. Preliminary observations suggest that certain regions generate high order volume but contribute disproportionately low or negative profit. As a **Business Data Analyst**, this project aims to evaluate whether regional shipping costs are a key driver behind the observed profit decline and to support decisions on optimizing the regional shipping strategy.

## Projects Outputs

## Decision Statement
Determine whether the company should optimize, adjust, or partially reduce regional shipping subsidies to improve overall profitability.

## Problem Hypothesis
High shipping costs in certain regions are eroding profit margins, causing those regions to underperform financially despite stable or growing revenue.
