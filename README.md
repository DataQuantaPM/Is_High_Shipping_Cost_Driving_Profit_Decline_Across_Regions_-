<img src="E Commerce.jpg" width="800">

<br>

## 📌 Business Context
The company operates a **Global E-Commerce Business** serving customers across multiple regions. While overall revenue performance appears stable, **Business Management** has raised concerns about uneven profitability across regions. Preliminary observations suggest that certain regions generate high order volume but contribute disproportionately low or negative profit. As a **Business Data Analyst**, this project aims to evaluate whether regional shipping costs are a key driver behind the observed profit decline and to support decisions on optimizing the regional shipping strategy.

<br>

## 📌 Decision Statement
Determine whether the company should optimize, adjust, or partially reduce regional shipping subsidies to improve overall profitability.

<br>


## 📌 Problem Hypothesis
High shipping costs in certain regions are eroding profit margins, causing those regions to underperform financially despite stable or growing revenue.

<br>

## 📌 Business Question
1️⃣. Which regions are underperforming in terms of profitability?

2️⃣. How significant is shipping cost relative to revenue across regions?

3️⃣. Is higher shipping cost associated with lower profit margins in certain regions?

4️⃣. Are profit losses concentrated in a small number of regions with high shipping costs?

5️⃣. Which regions present the highest potential for margin improvement if shipping costs are optimized?

<br>

## 📌 Metrics & Definitions
**Revenue :** Total sales value per order / region


**Profit :** Total profit value per order / region


**Profit Margin :** Profit / Revenue


**Shipping Cost :** Total shipping expense per order / region


**Shipping Cost Ratio :** Shipping Cost / Revenue

**Delivery Mode / Priority :** Ship Mode by region

<br>

## 📌 Key Insights
1️⃣ Profitability is highly concentrated in a small number of countries, while several regions consistently generate losses.

2️⃣ Loss-making countries are constrained by structural cost inefficiencies rather than insufficient demand.

3️⃣ Shipping cost per order is globally consistent. however, its impact is disproportionately damaging in low-revenue regions.

4️⃣ Premium shipping modes significantly increase cost per order without delivering proportional profit uplift.

5️⃣ Overuse of Same Day and First Class shipping particularly in Guatemala and Ukraine emerges as a primary driver of margin erosion.

6️⃣ Unit-level profitability analysis confirms that Same Day shipping is economically unsustainable in low-margin markets.

<br>

## 📌 Business Recommendation
🔹 **Recommendation 1 — Restrict Premium Shipping in Low-Margin Regions**

Limit Same Day and First Class shipping options in Guatemala and Ukraine, where unit-level profitability is consistently negative.

🔹 **Recommendation 2 — Introduce Order-Value Thresholds**

Enable premium shipping only for orders exceeding a defined revenue threshold to ensure cost recovery.

🔹 **Recommendation 3 — Default to Cost-Efficient Fulfillment**

Position Standard and Second Class shipping as default fulfillment options in low-margin regions.

🔹 **Recommendation 4 — Regional Fulfillment Policy**

Implement region-specific shipping policies rather than a uniform global approach to better align logistics costs with regional revenue potential.

<br>

## 📌 Trade-offs & Risks

**1️⃣. Reduced Customer Satisfaction from Limited Premium Shipping**

Restricting Same Day and First Class shipping options in low-margin regions may negatively impact customer experience, particularly for customers who value fast delivery. This could lead to lower customer satisfaction scores or reduced repeat purchase rates in the short term.

**🔹 Trade-off:**
Margin improvement vs. potential decline in service-level perception.

<br>

**2️⃣. Potential Revenue Impact from Order Friction**

Introducing order-value thresholds for premium shipping may discourage smaller orders or increase cart abandonment rates, especially in price-sensitive markets.

**🔹 Trade-off:**
Improved unit economics vs. possible reduction in order volume.

<br>

**3️⃣. Competitive Disadvantage in Certain Markets**

If competitors continue offering premium shipping options without restrictions, limiting these services may weaken competitive positioning in regions where delivery speed is a key differentiator.

**🔹 Trade-off:**
Cost control vs. market competitiveness.

<br>

**4️⃣. Operational Complexity from Regional Fulfillment Policies**

Implementing region-specific shipping rules increases operational complexity, requiring tighter coordination across logistics, pricing, and customer experience teams.

**🔹 Trade-off:**
More precise cost control vs. higher operational overhead.

<br>

**5️⃣. Risk of Misinterpreting Demand Elasticity**

Shipping mode changes assume that demand in loss-making regions is relatively inelastic to delivery speed. If customers are more sensitive to shipping speed than expected, order volume may decline more sharply than anticipated.

**🔹 Trade-off:**
Cost optimization vs. uncertainty in customer behavior response.

<br>

**6️⃣. Short-Term Performance Volatility**

Margin improvements from shipping policy changes may take time to materialize, while negative customer reactions could appear immediately.

**🔹 Trade-off:**
Short-term volatility vs. long-term profitability sustainability.

<br>

## 📌 Expected Impact

**1. Improved Unit-Level Profitability in Loss-Making Regions**

By restricting Same Day and First Class shipping in low-margin regions, the company is expected to reduce shipping cost per order without materially affecting demand.

**🔹 Expected impact:**

Reduction in per-order losses in Guatemala and Ukraine.

Stabilization of margins in regions where premium shipping currently erodes profitability

<br>

**2. Margin Recovery Without Revenue Dependence**

Since shipping cost per order is globally consistent and losses are not demand-driven, margin improvement does not rely on increasing order volume or revenue growth.

**🔹 Expected impact:**

Profitability improvement through cost control alone

Reduced risk associated with demand forecasting or pricing changes

<br>

**3. Reduced Loss Amplification from Volume Growth**

Current data indicates that higher order volumes in loss-making countries amplify losses due to unfavorable unit economics.

**🔹 Expected impact:**

Prevents further loss escalation as order volume grows

Enables safer scaling in affected regions after fulfillment policies are adjusted

<br>

**4. More Efficient Allocation of Premium Shipping Capacity**

Limiting premium shipping to high-value orders or high-margin regions allows logistics resources to be allocated where they generate positive returns.

**🔹 Expected impact:**

Better utilization of premium fulfillment options

Improved cost-to-value alignment across regions

<br>

**5. Foundation for Region-Specific Fulfillment Strategy**

Implementing differentiated shipping policies creates a framework for more granular cost control in the future.

**🔹 Expected impact:**

Greater flexibility in responding to regional margin dynamics

Improved long-term profitability governance

<br>

## 📌 Next Steps

**1️⃣. Apply Ship Mode Rules**

Restrict Same Day and First Class shipping based on order value, margin, or region profitability.

**2️⃣. Monitor Unit Economics**

Track profit per order and shipping cost ratios post-implementation to ensure margins improve as expected.

**3️⃣. Segment Regions**

Classify regions by fulfillment viability and apply region-specific shipping strategies.
