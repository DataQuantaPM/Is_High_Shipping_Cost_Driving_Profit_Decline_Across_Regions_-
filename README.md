## Business Context
The company operates a global e-commerce business serving customers across multiple regions. While overall revenue performance appears stable, management has raised concerns about uneven profitability across regions. Preliminary observations suggest that certain regions generate high order volume but contribute disproportionately low or negative profit. As a Business Data Analyst, this project aims to evaluate whether regional shipping costs are a key driver behind the observed profit decline and to support decisions on optimizing the regional shipping strategy.
